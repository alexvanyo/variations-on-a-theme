# variations-on-a-theme
### Team meetings:  
* Sundays at 2pm  
* Location TBD

### TODO for next meeting:
* Write a command line python file that takes in a MIDI file and writes another one out.
* Research and use a python library to handle MIDIs in your program
* Test MIDI file can be found in Slack or  [here](https://cs196fall16students.slack.com/files/jerryl3698/F2CV7AYE4/mary_had_a_little_lamb.mid)
* Commit your python file to the GitHub, titled with your name (we will decide which approach or combination of approaches becomes variations.py)
