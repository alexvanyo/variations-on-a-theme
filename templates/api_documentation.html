      <div>
      There is only one endpoint for the API:
      <ul>
        POST /api/variate
      </ul>
      </div>
        <div class="header">
            <h3 class="text-muted">POST /api/variate</h3>
        </div>
      <hr/>
        <div>
            Users may upload a file to this endpoint under a post request.
            <br><br>As of now users may upload files of type MIDI, MID.
            <br><br>Sample code for uploading a file with the requests library below:
      </div>
        <pre>
            import requests

            file = "/path/to/file/file.mid"
            url = "http://ec2-35-160-236-10.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/variate"
            files = {'files':open(file,"rb")}

            r = requests.post(url, files=files)
            fileURL = r.ur
            fileEncoding = r.encoding
            fileHeaders = r.headers
        </pre>
        <div>
            In this case r is returned as a Response object. It is up to the user to get the file from the url given by the Response object r.
            <br>How this will be done is left to the userâ€™s discretion.
            <br>In the event of a file processing error, the response object will return an error message as a String.
